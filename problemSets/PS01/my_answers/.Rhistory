# QUESTION 1: find a 90% Confidence Interval for the average IQ in the school
# below is a random sample of 25 students' IQ scores
y <- c(105, 69, 86, 100, 82, 111, 104, 110, 87, 108, 87, 90, 94, 113, 112, 98, 80, 97, 95, 111, 114, 89, 95, 126, 98)
# let's look at key data
sort(y) # reorder scores
mean(y) # Central tendency, mean
var(y) # Variability, variance
sd(y) # Variability, standard deviation
sd(y) / sqrt(length(y))  # Variability, standard **error**
summary(y)
# Some quick visualizations, to look at distribution
hist(y,
breaks = 5,
main = "Students' IQ scores",
xlab = "IQ score")
plot(y,
main="Students' IQ scores",
ylab="IQ scores")
#To find the 90% Confidence Interval, we look for the Point estimate +/- Margin of error,
# where margin of error is a multiple of the standard error
# What do we need?
mean(y) # Central tendency, mean - a point estimate
sd(y) / sqrt(length(y))  # Variability, the standard error
# How to find the multiple?
# Looking at the normal distribution, we see that 90% of observations lie within +/-1.64
# standard errors of the point estimate
?qnorm
qnorm(0.05) # value for first 5%
qnorm(0.95) # value last 5%
# Solution method 1: The **approximate** solution for 90% confidence level
upper_90 = mean(y)+(1.64*sd(y) / sqrt(length(y)))
lower_90 = mean(y)-(1.64*sd(y) / sqrt(length(y)))
#Summary
lower_90
mean(y)
upper_90
